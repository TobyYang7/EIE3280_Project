# My Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It's a simple, static site that includes information about me, my projects, and how to get in touch.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-personal-website.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```
cd my-personal-website
```

3. Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server

```
npm start
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) from your browser.

## Deployment

To build the static files for your website, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the files ready to be served by any static file server.

## Contributing

As this is a personal website, I am not accepting contributions. However, feel free to fork the project and use it as a starting point for your own site!
